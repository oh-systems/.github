<!-- ASCII BLOCK: OH LOGO -->

**Spatial experiences that transact, think, and operate — without leaving the world.**

## About

OH is a runtime for spatial commerce. We build infrastructure that lets immersive experiences handle real transactions, intelligent assistance, and operational continuity — all without pulling users out of the world.

Most digital environments treat commerce as external. You browse in-world, then get redirected to a website to actually buy. We think that's broken. OH keeps everything inside.

### Commerce Runtime
Infrastructure for in-world transactions. Cart state, checkout flow, payment processing, order confirmation, and failure handling — without external redirects.

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### O-OHs
Embodied AI agents that take real actions. Product discovery, cart management, checkout initiation, failure explanation, and support handoff — native to the experience.

### Identity + Session
Continuity across sessions and surfaces. Guest-to-login transitions, cross-surface state, and preference memory for commerce-relevant data.

### Experience Layer
Real-time rendering, spatial interfaces, and native UI for commerce — built in Unreal Engine with a focus on stability and performance.

## Principles

| | |
|---|---|
| **Commerce is native** | Transactions happen in-world or we haven't proven anything |
| **AI exists to act** | Conversation is only valuable if it triggers real actions |
| **Reliability first** | If the core doesn't work, nothing else matters |
